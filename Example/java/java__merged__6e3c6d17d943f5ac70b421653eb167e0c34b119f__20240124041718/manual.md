Semantic Consistency Analysis: The code changes in the commit do not accurately reflect the description provided in the commit message. The commit message mentions fixing an issue where onDismiss() did not get called if Snackbar is swiped, but the code changes do not address this issue. Instead, the code changes seem to be related to dismissing the Snackbar.

Security Analysis: No security analysis can be performed as the code is not provided.

Format Analysis: The format of the code aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: The highest priority comment is regarding the semantic consistency between the code changes and the commit message. The code changes should address the issue mentioned in the commit message, i.e., fixing the issue where onDismiss() did not get called if Snackbar is swiped. To fix this issue, the following changes can be made:

1. In the `Snackbar` class, modify the `dismiss()` method as follows:

```java
public void dismiss() {
    dismiss(mAnimated);
}

private void dismiss(boolean animate) {
    if (mIsDismissing) {
        return;
    }
    mIsDismissing = true;
    if (mEventListener != null) {
        mEventListener.onDismiss(Snackbar.this);
    }
    if (!animate) {
        finish();
        return;
    }
    // implementation
}
```

Please make the above changes to ensure that the code aligns with the description provided in the commit message.

Revised Code:

```java
public boolean canDismiss(Object token) {
    return true;
}

@Override
public void onDismiss(View view, Object token) {
    if (view != null) {
        dismiss(false);
    }
}

private void startTimer(long duration) {
    // implementation
}

public void dismiss() {
    dismiss(mAnimated);
}

private void dismiss(boolean animate) {
    if (mIsDismissing) {
        return;
    }
    mIsDismissing = true;
    if (mEventListener != null) {
        mEventListener.onDismiss(Snackbar.this);
    }
    if (!animate) {
        finish();
        return;
    }
    // implementation
}
```

Please review the revised code and make sure it addresses the issue mentioned in the commit message.
