# Code Review Feedback

Semantic Consistency Analysis:
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.

Security Analysis:
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.

Format Analysis:
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions:
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

Revised commit message: "Update Android SDK version to 21.1.0"

Revised code:
```python
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0
  # The SDK version used to compile your project
  - android-21
  # Specify at least one system image,
  # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests
```

Please make the necessary revisions to the commit message and code snippet to ensure semantic consistency and clarity.
