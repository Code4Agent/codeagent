    Security Analysis:
    Conduct a vulnerability analysis of the code. Identify if any modifications could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, attacks, or bugs. Provide details of any such findings.
    Format Analysis:
    Assess if the format of the code aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. Evaluate the impact of any formatting inconsistencies on the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
    For each of the above aspects, please provide a clear analysis and any necessary suggestions for improvement. If you find any issues, especially in the code, provide specific suggestions or rewritten code snippets to guide the commit contributor on how to make the necessary revisions.

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Semantic Consistency Analysis:
Upon reviewing the code changes and the corresponding commit message, I found that the changes in the code accurately reflect the description provided in the commit message. There are no inconsistencies or potential hidden malicious code.

Security Analysis:
I conducted a vulnerability analysis of the code and did not identify any modifications that could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, attacks, or bugs. The code appears to be secure.

Format Analysis:
I assessed the format of the code and compared it with the writing style and format of the original file. I found that there are some formatting inconsistencies that may impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project. Specifically, the indentation in the code is not consistent, which can make it difficult to understand the code structure.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions:
To improve the formatting consistency, I suggest aligning the indentation of the code properly. Here is the revised code with the suggested indentation changes:

```python
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0

  # The SDK version used to compile your project
  - android-20
  + android-21

  # Specify at least one system image,
  # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests
  - sys-img-armeabi-v7a-android-19
  - sys-img-x86-android-17
```

Revised code:
```python
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0

  # The SDK version used to compile your project
  - android-20
  + android-21

  # Specify at least one system image,
  # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests
  - sys-img-armeabi-v7a-android-19
  - sys-img-x86-android-17
```

Please make the necessary revisions to align the indentation as suggested above. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

You are Programmer. we are both working at CodeAgent. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: 
    I have a code, which includes the commit message, and the corresponding original file, these file are connected like this 
    code <PAD> commit message <PAD> original file. 
    If there is commit message is null, please don't do Semantic Consistency Analysis. if orignial file is null, please don't do Format Analysis.
    I would like a detailed code review based on the following three aspects:

    Semantic Consistency Analysis:
    Please analyze the semantic consistency between the code changes in side the code and the commit message. Check if the changes in the codes accurately reflect the description provided in the commit message. Highlight any inconsistencies that might lead to confusion or potential hidden malicious code.
    Security Analysis:
    Conduct a vulnerability analysis of the code. Identify if any modifications could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, attacks, or bugs. Provide details of any such findings.
    Format Analysis:
    Assess if the format of the code aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. Evaluate the impact of any formatting inconsistencies on the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
    For each of the above aspects, please provide a clear analysis and any necessary suggestions for improvement. If you find any issues, especially in the code, provide specific suggestions or rewritten code snippets to guide the commit contributor on how to make the necessary revisions.

    

    The final feedback should be structured as follows:
    Semantic Consistency Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Security Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Format Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: [Your proposed code revisions for the commit or suggestions, if any]

Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.

Security Analysis: 
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.

Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

Revised commit message: "Update Android SDK version to 21.1.0"

Revised code:
```python
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0
  # The SDK version used to compile your project
  - android-21
  # Specify at least one system image,
  # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests
```

Please make the necessary revisions to the commit message and code as suggested above.

Comments on COMMIT:
"Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.

Security Analysis: 
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.

Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

Revised commit message: "Update Android SDK version to 21.1.0"

Revised code:
```python
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0
  # The SDK version used to compile your project
  - android-21
  # Specify at least one system image,
  # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests
```

Please make the necessary revisions to the commit message and code as suggested above."

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[CodeAgent is a code review company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief product officer, code reviewer, security analyst, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "building a autonomous codeagent for company to do code review for commits".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at CodeAgent. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, do vulnerability analysis, do consistency between commit and commit message, do format analysis between commit and original file, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
    I have a code, which includes the commit message, and the corresponding original file, these file are connected like this 
    code <PAD> commit message <PAD> original file. 
    If there is commit message is null, please don't do Semantic Consistency Analysis. if orignial file is null, please don't do Format Analysis.
    I would like a detailed code review based on the following three aspects:

    Semantic Consistency Analysis:
    Please analyze the semantic consistency between the code changes in side the code and the commit message. Check if the changes in the codes accurately reflect the description provided in the commit message. Highlight any inconsistencies that might lead to confusion or potential hidden malicious code.
    Security Analysis:
    Conduct a vulnerability analysis of the code. Identify if any modifications could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, attacks, or bugs. Provide details of any such findings.
    Format Analysis:
    Assess if the format of the code aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. Evaluate the impact of any formatting inconsistencies on the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
    For each of the above aspects, please provide a clear analysis and any necessary suggestions for improvement. If you find any issues, especially in the code, provide specific suggestions or rewritten code snippets to guide the commit contributor on how to make the necessary revisions.

    

    The final feedback should be structured as follows:
    Semantic Consistency Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Security Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Format Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]

Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.
Security Analysis: 
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.
Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

[CodeAgent is a code review company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief product officer, code reviewer, security analyst, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "building a autonomous codeagent for company to do code review for commits".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at CodeAgent. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, do vulnerability analysis, do consistency between commit and commit message, do format analysis between commit and original file, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: 
    I have a code, which includes the commit message, and the corresponding original file, these file are connected like this 
    code <PAD> commit message <PAD> original file. 
    If there is commit message is null, please don't do Semantic Consistency Analysis. if orignial file is null, please don't do Format Analysis.
    I would like a detailed code review based on the following three aspects:

    Semantic Consistency Analysis:
    Please analyze the semantic consistency between the code changes in side the code and the commit message. Check if the changes in the codes accurately reflect the description provided in the commit message. Highlight any inconsistencies that might lead to confusion or potential hidden malicious code.
    Security Analysis:
    Conduct a vulnerability analysis of the code. Identify if any modifications could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, attacks, or bugs. Provide details of any such findings.
    Format Analysis:
    Assess if the format of the code aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. Evaluate the impact of any formatting inconsistencies on the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
    For each of the above aspects, please provide a clear analysis and any necessary suggestions for improvement. If you find any issues, especially in the code, provide specific suggestions or rewritten code snippets to guide the commit contributor on how to make the necessary revisions.

Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.
Security Analysis: 
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.
Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

[2024-21-01 00:52:23 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.

Security Analysis: 
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.

Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.

Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

Revised commit message: "Update Android SDK version to 21.1.0"

Revised code:
```yaml
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0

Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.

Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Semantic Consistency Analysis: 
Based on the provided commit message and the code changes, there seems to be a semantic inconsistency. The commit message mentions "Travis update", but there are no code changes related to Travis or any update. This inconsistency might lead to confusion for other developers who are reviewing the commit or trying to understand the changes made. It is important to ensure that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the code.
Security Analysis: 
No security vulnerabilities or potential attacks were identified in the code.
Format Analysis: 
The format of the code seems to align with the writing style and format of the original file. There are no formatting inconsistencies that impact the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
Code Alignment/Revision Suggestions: 
Based on the semantic inconsistency identified, I suggest revising the commit message to accurately reflect the changes made in the code. Instead of mentioning "Travis update", the commit message should provide a clear description of the actual changes made in the code.
Revised commit message: "Update Android SDK version to 21.1.0"
Revised code:
'''
android:
  - build-tools-21.1.0
  # The SDK version used to compile your project
  - android-21
  # Specify at least one system image,
  # if you need to run emulator(s) during your tests

```
"
As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: requirements.txt
```
android==21.1.0
```
Explanation:
Based on the provided code, it seems that the project requires the Android SDK version 21.1.0 and the build tools version 21.1.0. Therefore, the requirements.txt file should specify the dependency as "android==21.1.0". This ensures that the correct version of the Android SDK is installed when setting up the project. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

You are responsible for all product-related matters in CodeAgent. Usually includes product design, product strategy, product vision, product innovation, project management and product marketing.
Here is a new customer's task: 
    I have a code, which includes the commit message, and the corresponding original file, these file are connected like this 
    code <PAD> commit message <PAD> original file. 
    If there is commit message is null, please don't do Semantic Consistency Analysis. if orignial file is null, please don't do Format Analysis.
    I would like a detailed code review based on the following three aspects:

    Semantic Consistency Analysis:
    Please analyze the semantic consistency between the code changes in side the code and the commit message. Check if the changes in the codes accurately reflect the description provided in the commit message. Highlight any inconsistencies that might lead to confusion or potential hidden malicious code.
    Security Analysis:
    Conduct a vulnerability analysis of the code. Identify if any modifications could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities, attacks, or bugs. Provide details of any such findings.
    Format Analysis:
    Assess if the format of the code aligns with the writing style and format of the original file. Evaluate the impact of any formatting inconsistencies on the overall readability and maintainability of the project.
    For each of the above aspects, please provide a clear analysis and any necessary suggestions for improvement. If you find any issues, especially in the code, provide specific suggestions or rewritten code snippets to guide the commit contributor on how to make the necessary revisions.

    

    The final feedback should be structured as follows:
    Semantic Consistency Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Security Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]
    Format Analysis: [Your detailed analysis and suggestions]

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
